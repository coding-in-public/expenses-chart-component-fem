# Frontend Mentor - Expenses chart component

![Design preview for the Expenses chart component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I coded out this on a livestream here: https://youtu.be/OkKcKzc9iK0

## Follow Along
To follow along, download/clone the code and open it in your code editor. Assuming you have npm installed, open a terminal in your code editor and type the following commands:

`npm i`

AND THEN â€¦

`npm run dev`

That will kick off the tailwind script. Open the project with Live Server or something simliar. Enjoy! ðŸ˜ƒ
